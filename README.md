# Tensorflow-mnist-train
A tensorflow project just train model using mnist datasets in keras and test model by using picture of numbers.

# Technical points
## Mnist datasets
Using mnist datasets provided by keras in tensorflow
## Customize dense nn structure
1. Using 2 dense layers network structure, 1 for ReLU activation function, another for softmax
2. Using Adam Optimizer
3. Using sparse categorical crossentropy loss function
## Picture file IO
Using PIL to load picture files and pretreatment
## Draw chart
Using matplotlib to draw accuracy and loss chart
